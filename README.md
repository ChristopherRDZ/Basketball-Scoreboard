# Basketball Scoreboard Webpage

This project is a simple webpage of the first solo project from <a href="https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v" target="_blank">Learn JavaScript Course</a>, that simulates a basketball scoreboard. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While attempts were made to make the webpage responsive, it is not 100% efficient. Nevertheless, it serves as a fun project for practicing front-end development skills. You can access the page by clicking <a href="https://stately-semolina-6a926b.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.
